\chapter*{Preface}

Yes. Number Theory is hard. Thus, to help those middle school students without
any tuition, this book is created. In this book, I'm going to cover basics of
number theory so that you will have a basic understanding on Number Theory and
you can read \textbf{Modern Olympiad Number Theory by Aditya Khurmi} afterward
easier.


Since this is a pretty basic book, you don't need any advanced knowledge to
complete this book. However, basic knowledges like: \textbf{AP, GP, set
	theory, binomial coefficients} are highly recommended.

By the way, I really apologize if my English is bad since I'm not native English
speaker. And - you \textbf{should} do the exercises yourself so you will
convice yourself why the method works. You are highly recommended to solve
everything yourself without any help.

I hope you would have a great time while reading this book. Thank you!
